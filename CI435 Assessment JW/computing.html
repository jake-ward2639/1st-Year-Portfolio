    <h2>Response, Prevention &amp; Recovery</h2>
    <p>When we are talking about cybersecurity in computers, the solutions and techniques can be categorised under the following;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Prevention</b>&nbsp;- preventing potential attacks and data loss before they happen. This often refers to real-time protection such as antivirus, ad blockers and firewalls downloaded onto machines.</li>
    <li><b>Response</b>&nbsp;- if an attack were to happen, how would you or your team respond to it. This will involve developing an effective incident response plan and rehearsing. The focus should be on containment and/or eradication of the threat.</li>
    <li><b>Recovery</b>&nbsp;- the process of recovering after an attack. Examples can range from restoring from backups to pursuing legal action.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some techniques such as Penetration testing can be classed as both a prevention and response technique depending on the way it is used and what to test. No matter the context, if your goal is to maintain the security of your devices, these are the processes you will need in place. Whether through software, planning or rehearsal: Prevent, Respond and Recover.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Incident Response</h2>
    <p>If your preventative measures are strong enough then you should hopefully never need to respond to an attack. However, you must prepare for all possibilities by creating a plan to be enacted in the event those preventative measures fail. This will be known as an incident response plan. Your goal will be the detection, analysation, quarantine and eradication of the threat; all the while preventing as much damage as possible. While the NSCS set up the CIR (Cyber Incident Response) as an organisation certified to help with targeted attacks, this service is only available to organisations with networks of national significance. If the attack is targeted at your pc the solution will often be a feature of your antivirus with the worst case being a reset or reinstallation. But if sensitive information is at risk of loss, especially if it will risk the privacy of another, then an incident response plan will be vital.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The process of incident response can be taken in two different ways, business-focused or cyber security-focused; both of which are equally valid should ideally be pursued. When developing an incident response plan, the first step is to make key contacts available to the relevant parties such as employees. If the qualified contacts for response are unavailable or hard to contact, then the attack will surely last longer and potentially do irreparable damage. Consider that an attack could happen at any time, thus it is a good idea to have multiple contact methods as well as multiple contacts.&nbsp;IR team, IT, Senior Management, Legal, PR, HR, Insurance are all valid key contacts.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Escalation criteria should also be established. This is a guide to show the level of severity the threat needs to be, in order to contact different parties or warrant different levels of action. For example, if adware is bothering employees, then it is not severe enough to warrant informing management, however the IT team will be a valid contact seeing as it is not only within their level of expertise but it is a low priority issue. It should be made clear that contacting overqualified or high priority parties for low priority issues is equally damaging to the company, as they are wasting time that could be spent on more important issues. While all users/employees should be able to diagnose the severity of a situation, it is not a realistic outlook. It should be the average user's responsibility to report a problem or attack and the IT department's responsibility to use the set escalation criteria to establish the severity and priority level. The criteria you create to dictate this could have to do with the number of machines affected, the possible damage to the company, whether sensitive information is at risk and should maybe be created with the consultation of professionals. Severity can easily be measured by anyone if the creation and use of checklists are made based on your established criteria.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A full incident life-cycle should be created and made available to educate all users of how an incident is resolved and their responsibilities/place in the cycle, as well as the use of the escalation criteria. This can be based on experience with a previous attack or simply by the suggestion of professionals. Some would go as far as to rehearse this cycle, so as to hone the company's incident response capabilities and familiarise the staff.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Finally, at least one conference number should be provided in case of a severe or urgent incident and it should equally be decided at which criteria level legal support should be involved.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Penetration Testing</h2>
    <p>To ensure a system or device is protected, companies will often use penetration testing. Penetration testing is defined by the NCSC as&nbsp;"A method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some or all of that system's security, using the same tools and techniques as an adversary might". However, to put it in layman's terms, penetration testing is when software is used or professionals (known as white hat hackers or ethical hackers) are hired to attempt to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; into the device or system, so that they can identify its weaknesses. If an attack on a device is successful then the hiring party is told about the weakness and the tester will create or suggest a defensive measure to prevent it in future. This is done not only to prevent sensitive data theft but because of the huge reputational damage from a successful attack. If you know a company is possibly going to lose your data, then you will no longer trust them and the company loses business. That is why we have penetration testing, to inform us on how to prevent an attack in the first place.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ideally, a penetration test should show the results you expect, this is why it is important to have third party testers, to further verify your security and remove any bias. Tests can only be focused on known issues. Due to this, and the fact that technology is evolving at such&nbsp;a fast pace, it is a good idea to make testing a regular occurrence. Weaknesses are reported as the vulnerability in the system and the technique used to abuse it, as well as advice to defend against the potential attack and the level of risk. They will often compare risk assessments as well, to show the accuracy or inaccuracy of your company's assessment.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Types of Penetration Testing</h3>
    <p><b>Whitebox Testing</b>&nbsp;is when all known information about the issue or target is shared with testers so as to confirm the efficiency and accuracy of your internally vulnerability assessment whereas&nbsp;<b>Blackbox Testing</b>&nbsp;is the exact opposite and is used to represent an external perspective into the security. Any test can be run as either of these.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The NCSC identifies the three main types of test as &ldquo;Vulnerability identification in bespoke or niche software&rdquo;, &ldquo;Scenario driven testing aimed at identifying vulnerabilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scenario driven testing of detection and response capability&rdquo;. Vulnerability identification in bespoke or niche software means to give feedback to developers on coding practices avoiding vulnerability identification, this is often used with web application testing. Scenario driven testing aimed at identifying vulnerabilities means to explore a specific scenario and see as to whether a vulnerability presents itself. Scenario driven testing of detection and response capability&nbsp;is similar but is instead used to test the effectiveness of your response capabilities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Types of Threats</h2>
    <p>The main types of threats to a computer come under the titles of vulnerabilities and malware. Vulnerabilities are imperfections that can be used to gain access to a system, in order to disrupt normal functions. When in the preparation phase of system creation, vulnerabilities should be considered at every step. This applies to hardware, software, data and people. On the other hand, malware is a blanket term for dangerous/ malicious software that if able to run, can infect a system and cause harm in many ways such as taking control of the system, creation of botnets and stealing, deleting or encrypting data.</p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h3>Forms of Vulnerabilities</h3>
    <p>Hardware:</p>
    <p>Using hardware it is very simple to add, change or remove devices which can enable an attacker to change the configuration of a computer. Physical vulnerabilities however, are the most important aspect as they are harder to trace and have a wide range of potential issues. Such as physical objects being tampered with before entering an organization's hands or doors in a building/access to computers not being controlled or monitored correctly.</p>
    <p>Software:</p>
    <p>Software can present vulnerabilities as it is very simple to modify and large amounts of data can be stored inside which can allow an attacker to access and steal it. Software can also have vulnerabilities in the form of bugs or flaws in it&rsquo;s design which can give attackers a backdoor to skip access control. These backdoors can also come in the form of mistakes by the person who coded the software. Lastly, software can also be attacked by viruses which will be explained further below.</p>
    <p>Data vulnerabilities:</p>
    <p>Data has vulnerabilities in its nature of being an easy to edit, valuable commodity. It can be easily deleted or stolen and has a higher occurrence of attacks targeted at it. It can also be changed very slowly or rounded incorrectly, which can present issues once exploited.</p>
    <p>Human vulnerabilities:</p>
    <p>One of the most important vulnerabilities is the human factor. Key users can easily be targeted for social engineering which can lead to exploits in mail procedures and the loss of data. Users are also often very naive to an attacker's methods and security for organizations can drastically underestimate the effectiveness of exploiting human vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Forms of Malware</h3>
    <p>While you may know of the generic type of malware known as a virus there are many more variations and types. The term virus actually only refers to a type of malware that spreads through other programs. Viruses can produce many damages including slowing processing power and deleting files and applications. However the term malware, also known as malicious software, comes in many more complex forms.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Worms:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Worms are a stand-alone form of malware that do not require a program to attach to. They are self-replicating and spread from device to device, meaning they can not only damage a device but an entire network very quickly. An example you may have seen would be in your friends' social media accounts spamming damaging links. The links infect your account if clicked and the process will repeat itself. Worms will take up space and processing power so you can manually scan for them by keeping an eye on your disk space, performance and any potential missing files. Worms mostly rely on software vulnerabilities, so make sure your operating system is up to date.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Trojans:</p>
    <p>
        <figure>
        <img src="images\Ancient Greece Trojan Horse Enters Troy - Vector Image.png" alt="Trojans" style="width:20rem;height:15rem;margin-right:15px; float:right; padding-left:1rem";>
        
       
    </figure>
    Get their name from the story of Troy and the trojan horse, this is because it disguises itself as a useful or legitimate program but, once run, will infect and damage your device. Luckily, trojans can be picked up and quarantined by most antivirus. You can avoid downloading trojans by only installing legitimate software and carefully vetting those which you do install. Seeing as trojans will need themselves to be downloaded and run, there have been increasingly inventive ways of tricking or socially engineering people to trust the application and download. This has recently included hijacking calendars and notifications to fake updates of antivirus and other programs. While the open source community can be useful, you must also be aware that any application made by individuals could potentially hold trojans, a second opinion can never hurt.</p>
    
    <p>Spyware:</p>
    <p>Spyware is pretty self-explanatory. Once spyware has installed itself on your device, pc or network, it will attempt to steal sensitive information, which can range from bank details to social media logins. Like worms, a common practice is to spread through stolen social media accounts by spamming the accounts of friends in the hopes of infecting more. Spyware will not make itself known, as its goal is to go undetected; however, any antivirus worth its money should discover spyware upon a scan.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ransomware:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ransomware is a form of malware that holds your pc, device or files hostage until a requirement is met (usually until a ransom is paid, hence the name). They can hold your files by locking your pc, threatening to delete files or meddle with accounts. You must never pay any ransom, even if it sounds like the quickest and easiest solution, it's unnecessary, expensive and there is no guarantee that the attacker will actually hold up their end of the bargain. While you can often recover from an attack by ignoring the ransom and restoring to a previous state in the device or system's life via backups, you are likely going to want to prevent ransomwares invasion in the first place.
